# Minor Project
## Smart Health Consultant and Management System
### Idea :
Consulting a doctor is a quite obvious thing in our day-to-day life, but the availability of the doctor during the time of our requirement is unpredictable. In order to overcome this issue a proposal of GUI application is made; this smart health application enables users to express their symptoms and issues. It then processes users’ issues and symptoms to check for various health issues that could be associated with the symptoms given by the user If the application is unable to provide a particular solution then it depends on user to arrange another appointment with the doctor 



### Modules :
<b>Module 1: USER REGISTRATION AND VERIFICATION</b> :Registration is one of the primary modules in each and every project. A patient's medical record management starts with registering a patient with the system. it is extremely important to keep the registration module generalized in a way where it can be configured to take registration information about a patient according to the needs of the implementer.<br>
